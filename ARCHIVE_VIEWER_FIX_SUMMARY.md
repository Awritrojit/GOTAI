# Archive Viewer Browser Tab - Issue Resolution

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Method Name Mismatch**
- **Issue**: Archive viewer was calling `this.graph.updateGraph()` but GraphVisualizer class only had `update()` method
- **Fix**: Changed `updateGraph()` to `update()` in archive_viewer.html

### 2. **Missing Methods in GraphVisualizer**
- **Issue**: Archive viewer expected `togglePrunedNodes()` method that didn't exist
- **Fix**: Added `togglePrunedNodes(showPruned)` method to GraphVisualizer class

### 3. **Conflicting Initialization**
- **Issue**: graph.js had its own DOMContentLoaded listener that tried to initialize with elements that don't exist in archive viewer
- **Fix**: Made graph.js initialization defensive - only initialize if required elements exist

### 4. **Poor Error Handling**
- **Issue**: JavaScript errors were silent, making debugging difficult
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling, console logging, and visual error display

### 5. **Missing Data Storage**
- **Issue**: `togglePrunedNodes()` needed access to last graph data
- **Fix**: Modified `update()` method to store `this.lastGraphData`

## Changes Made

### frontend/archive_viewer.html
- Fixed method call from `updateGraph()` to `update()`
- Added comprehensive error handling and debugging
- Added loading progress indicators
- Added global error handler
- Improved initialization checks

### frontend/js/graph.js
- Added `togglePrunedNodes(showPruned)` method
- Made initialization defensive (check if elements exist)
- Modified `update()` method to store `lastGraphData`
- Fixed checkbox handling to be more robust

## Testing

Created multiple debug tools:
- `test_archive_complete.py` - Backend API verification
- `debug_step_by_step.html` - Frontend step-by-step debugging
- `test_archive_debug.html` - Basic API test

All tests pass and the archive viewer now works correctly.

## Current Status

✅ **RESOLVED**: Archive viewer in browser tabs now displays archived runs correctly
✅ **WORKING**: Graph visualization renders properly
✅ **WORKING**: Node details display on click
✅ **WORKING**: Archive metadata shows correctly
✅ **WORKING**: All UI controls function properly

The archive viewing in separate browser tabs is now fully functional.
